## Enemies

### Sand shark

Really fast creature, that moves in the sand like through a water. Apprearance - long worm with a ton of fins to dig the sand. Way to outplay - stand on rocks.

### Antlion

Antlion, catches a prey that falls to its sand funnel. If a pray tries to jump over - it launches itself trying to catch it mid-flight. Really low mobility, but instant kill of a catched pray.
Way to outplay - lure it to jump out of funnel, by throwing some big objects (larger that a rock or a spear) - snails, noodleflies, killed squidcadas, etc.

## Grunt

Overgrown ants, that live in colonies. Neutral by default (the whole room is aggrivated), always aggresive in taDEAN. Can be traded with for spears and some valuables, in exchange of food.
Uses sounds to communicate with other grunts. If killed before a screech - other grunts won't know about the issue (until they stumble upon a body).

## Fruit mimic

Parasitic creature that mimics blue fruits. Is different fron regular blue fruits by its stem - it is a long dark tongue actually.

When eaten alive - starts digesting a host from inside (when hunger bar reaches 0 - hosts dies shortly). The way to neutrolize it is by eating a pufferfruit or standing in its cloud.
